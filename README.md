Install and configure postfix on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    postfix_aliases:
      - name: root
        destination: robert@meinit.nl

  roles:
    - robertdebock.postfix
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for postfix

# These settings are required in postfix.
postfix_myhostname: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
postfix_mydomain: "{{ ansible_domain | default ('localdomain', true) }}"
postfix_myorigin: "{{ ansible_domain | default ('localdomain', true) }}"

# To "listen" on public interfaces, set inet_interfaces to something like
# "all" or the name of the interface, such as "eth0".
postfix_inet_inferfaces: "loopback-only"

# The distination tells Postfix what mails to accept mail for.
postfix_mydestination: $mydomain, $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost

# To accept email from other machines, set the mynetworks to something like
# "192.168.0.0/24".
postfix_mynetworks: "127.0.0.0/8"

# These settings change the role of the postfix server to a relay host.
# postfix_relay_domains: "$mydestination"

# If you want to forward emails to another central relay server, set relayhost.
# use brackets to sent to the A-record of the relayhost.
# postfix_relayhost: [relay.example.com]

# Set the restrictions for receiving mails.
postfix_smtpd_recipient_restrictions:
  - permit_mynetworks
  - permit_sasl_authenticated
  - reject_unauth_destination
  - reject_invalid_hostname
  - reject_non_fqdn_hostname
  - reject_non_fqdn_sender
  - reject_non_fqdn_recipient
  - reject_unknown_sender_domain
  - reject_unknown_recipient_domain
  - reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org
  - reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org

# To enable spamassassin, ensure spamassassin is installed,
# (hint: role: robertdebock.spamassassin) and set these two variables:
# postfix_spamassassin: enabled
# postfix_spamassassin_user: spamd

# To enable clamav, ensure clamav is installed,
# (hint: role: robertdebock.clamav) and set this variable:
# postfix_clamav: enabled

# You can configure aliases here. Typically redirecting `root` is a good plan.
# postfix_aliases:
#   - name: root
#     destination: robert@meinit.nl
```
